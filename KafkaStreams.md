Kafka Streams and Kafka Listener are both APIs for consuming and processing data in Apache Kafka. However, they have different strengths and weaknesses.

Kafka Streams is a more powerful API that can be used to perform complex processing on data streams. It also provides built-in support for distributed processing and fault tolerance. However, Kafka Streams can be more complex to use than Kafka Listener.

Kafka Listener is a simpler API that is easier to use. It is also more lightweight than Kafka Streams, which makes it a good choice for applications that do not need the full power of Kafka Streams. However, Kafka Listener does not provide the same level of support for distributed processing and fault tolerance as Kafka Streams.

In general, Kafka Streams is a good choice for applications that need to perform complex processing on data streams. Kafka Listener is a good choice for applications that do not need the full power of Kafka Streams and are looking for a simpler API.
You should use Kafka Streams when you need to perform complex processing on data streams. Kafka Streams provides a number of features that make it easier to develop stream processing applications, such as stateless and stateful processing, distributed processing, fault tolerance, windowing, aggregation, joins, correlation, filtering, mapping, reducing, splitting, and transforming.

You should use Kafka Listener when you are looking for a simpler API for consuming and processing data in Apache Kafka. Kafka Listener is a lower-level API than Kafka Streams, but it is easier to use. Kafka Listener can be used to consume messages from a topic, process messages, and produce messages to a topic.

Here is a table that summarizes when to use Kafka Streams and Kafka Listener:

| Use case                |	Kafka Streams |	Kafka Listener |
|-------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Complex processing      |	Yes	|No|
| Simpler API             |	No	|Yes|
| Distributed processing	 |Yes	|No|
| Fault tolerance	        |Yes	|No|
| Windowing	              |Yes	|No|
| Aggregation	            |Yes	|No|
| Joins	                  |Yes	|No|
| Correlation	            |Yes	|No|
| Filtering	              |Yes	|No|
| Mapping	                |Yes	|No|
| Reducing	               |Yes	|No|
| Splitting	              |Yes	|No|
| Transforming	           |Yes	|No|

Here are some additional details about when to use each API:

Kafka Streams

Kafka Streams is a good choice for applications that need to perform complex processing on data streams. For example, you might use Kafka Streams to:

- Calculate real-time metrics
- Detect anomalies
- Perform machine learning
- Build real-time dashboards
Kafka Listener

Kafka Listener is a good choice for applications that do not need the full power of Kafka Streams and are looking for a simpler API. For example, you might use Kafka Listener to:

- Consume messages from a topic and store them in a database
- Produce messages to a topic from a database
- Implement a simple pub/sub system
Ultimately, the best way to decid e which API to use is to consider your specific needs. If you are not sure which API is right for you, you can always consult with an experienced Kafka developer.
